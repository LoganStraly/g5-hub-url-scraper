# g5-hub-url-scraper

This tool is essentially a recreation of the original "URL Collector" created by Sydney Koncz.
We created this in preparation for the sunsetting of the @getg5.com email address (which I believe that Chrome extension was whitelisted to).
EDIT: The above statement is actually false. The chrome extension still seems to work without being logged into a @getg5.com email address. Regardless, this tool seems to be more robust, and works in the modern G5 Hub.

Just throw the code from the 'remote-load.js' into a Chrome bookmark (creating a Bookmarklet), and click in when you're on the "home" page of a client in the G5 Hub.
